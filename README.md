# Selenium tutorial
A few words about me. I am a beginner in the tester profession.
I am friendly, eager to learn and want to share all that I have learned with you.
Probably because I understand the difficulties at the beginning with no one guides.
Hope you will understand the ideas that I want to covey in these lessons.
